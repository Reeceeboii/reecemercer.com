## My first hackathon!

I have never attended any hackathons before, which I guess is a weird thing for a computer science student. However, I was passed on details of a mini-hackathon (done in a day) that was taking place at the Morgan Stanley offices in Canary Wharf by a friend, and I signed up. Due to MS being quite a high profile company for university students, I wasn't expecting to get a place, but soon I received an email confirming my place and a few days later, I found myself on a train down to Canada Water.

This was also my first time in Canary Wharf, and all I thought when I got there was just 'wow'. Huge tower blocks for literally every bank you can imagine just surround you in all directions.
